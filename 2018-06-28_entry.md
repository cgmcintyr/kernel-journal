# Compiling and running Linux 4.17.2

* Downloaded [kernel tarball](https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/linux-4.17.2.tar.xz) from kernel archive.
* 4.17.2 was stable at time of writing.
* Was necessary to install a number of packages.
    - Minimal requirements can be found in `Documentation/process/changes.rst`.
* Flex and bison are new dependencies as of 4.16, seems to be something to do with kconfig
    - "The parser used by the configuration system is now directly generated with flex and bison; those tools are thus now part of the kernel's build requirements." [LWN: 4.16 Merge window part 1](https://lwn.net/Articles/746129/).
* Copied old config from `/boot` as `.config` then ran `make oldconfig` to update it.
* `make` took a *long* time.
* Upon completion I ran `sudo make modules_install install` to install the new kernel and add grub menu item.
    - Seems to have added the kernel and some related files to `/boot`
    - Next time I'll look at what `modules_install` is actually doing...
* Restarted laptop and ran kernel
    - Fedora launched automatically, how did it know to run Fedora OS?
    - Seems to be running fine.
